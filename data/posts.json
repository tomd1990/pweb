It is my sincerest wish that this site will not only showcase my abilities as a programmer, but will also show you who I am as a person.  With that in mind I want to emphasize that this is a personal site, and I will be expressing myself to the fullest of my capabilities. All, while staying out of correctional facilities.  So sit back, relax, butter up some popcorn and stay a while."
