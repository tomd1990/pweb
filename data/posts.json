Yes it axed many of the beloved SF2 characters, yes it redefined core mechanics, yes it had balancing issues.  But despite all this, no other street fighter even came close to surpassing it.  The game was incredibly polished, and had a level of personality that just oozed out from every seam.  The soundtrack, the character sprites, and the overall feel of the game had an incredible amount of detail.  Something that newer games fail to capture.  To put it simply SF3 had soul and style, and to this day stands out as a masterpiece in an ocean of the bland and mediocre.</p><a class=\"more\" href=\"/app/views/home.html#/post/1\" onclick=\"play()\">Read on</a>" ,
